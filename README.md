# first official website
## introduction
Making a website is a lot more complicated than I thought; there are various languages
that need to be learned along the journey aside from the infamous HTML and CSS.
This personal website of mine will change over time as long as I have the liberty
and interest to do so. I will be recording all my psychological
thoughts, interests, and basically everything that I deem to share.
